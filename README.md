# Final Project
### Authors: Ruining Zheng, Jane Finocharo, and Adriana Vance

This is the github repository for our final project for our Advanced Data Science for Public Police course. 
In this project, we design two predictive models that predict food insecurity levels in counties based on sociodemographic and food policy characteristics. Using these models, we simulate changes in program participation to see how they affect food insecurity levels in counties.
